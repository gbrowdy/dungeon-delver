# Rogue

A roguelike browser game with auto-combat mechanics, built with React and TypeScript.

### Features

- **4 Playable Classes**: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Paladin, each with unique starting stats and abilities
- **Auto-Combat System**: Automatic attacks with manual power activation and blocking
- **Progression**: Level up, find equipment, and unlock new powers as you advance

- **Enemy Variety**: Face common enemies, rare encounters, and challenging bosses with unique abilities
