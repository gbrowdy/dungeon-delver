# Rogue

A roguelike browser game with auto-combat mechanics and path-based character progression, built with React and TypeScript.

*This project was vibecoded with AI assistance.*

## Gameplay

Battle through 10 floors of increasingly difficult enemies, defeat the final boss, and claim victory. Combat is automatic—your hero attacks on their own—but you control when to use special powers and block incoming attacks.

### Features

- **4 Playable Classes**: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Paladin, each with unique starting stats and abilities
- **Path System**: Choose your playstyle at level 2 (active or passive), then unlock powerful abilities as you level up
- **Auto-Combat System**: Automatic attacks with manual power activation and blocking
- **Progression**: Level up, visit the shop for equipment, and unlock new powers as you advance
- **Enemy Variety**: Face common enemies, rare encounters, and challenging bosses with unique abilities
- **10 Floors**: Battle through themed dungeon floors culminating in a final boss showdown
